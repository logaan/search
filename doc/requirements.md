# Coding Challenge

## OVERVIEW

Using the provided data ( `tickets.json` and `users.json` and
`organization.json` ) write a simple command line application to search the data
and return the results in a human readable format. Feel free to use libraries or
roll your own code as you see fit. Where the data exists, values from any
related entities should be included in the results. The user should be able to
search on any field, full value matching is fine (e.g. “mar” won’t return
“mary”). The user should also be able to search for empty values, e.g. where
description is empty.

Search can get pretty complicated pretty easily, we just want to see that you
can code a basic search application.

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

We will look at your project and assess it for:

1. Extensibility - separation of concerns.
2. Simplicity - aim for the simplest solution that gets the job done whilst
   remaining readable, extensible and testable.
3. Test Coverage - breaking changes should break your tests.
4. Performance - should gracefully handle a significant increase in amount of
   data provided (e.g 10000+ users).
5. Robustness - should handle and report errors.

If you have any questions about this criteria please ask.

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Use the language in which you are strongest.
* Include a README with (accurate) usage instructions.
 
## SUBMISSION

Github is the preferred option (a public repo is fine) but we will also accept a
.zip file if necessary. Email your solution to xxx.
